# Chest Tube Management Protocol for Traumatic Chest Wall Injury

## Definition
Structured management pathway for patients with **pneumothorax (PTX)**, **hemopneumothorax (HPTX)**, or **hemothorax (HTX)** following traumatic chest wall injury. The goal is to ensure safe, timely chest tube management and minimize retained hemothorax, empyema, or prolonged tube duration.

## Principles
- All traumatic chest injuries with PTX, HPTX, or HTX require **prompt chest tube placement** and **post-placement imaging confirmation**.  
- All chest tubes should be placed on **–20 mmHg suction** initially.  
- Early imaging at **24 hours post-placement** guides ongoing management.  
- Decision-making depends on **air leak status**, **drainage volume**, and **radiographic findings**.

## Stepwise Evaluation

### 1. Initial Management
1. **Chest Tube Placement**
   - Indications: PTX, HPTX, HTX following trauma.
2. **Apply –20 mmHg suction** to all chest tubes.
3. **Obtain imaging** (CXR) to confirm proper placement and lung re-expansion.

### 2. 24-Hour Chest X-Ray Evaluation

#### A. PTX or HPTX
- **Findings:** Resolved PTX, no new or worsening subcutaneous emphysema (subQE)
- **Pleurovac:** No air leak, **<300 mL** effluent in the last 24 hours
- **Patient:** Not intubated on high ventilatory settings
- **Action:** Transition to **water seal (WS)**

#### B. Persistent Opacities or Pleural Effusion
- **Findings:** Persistent pleural effusion or opacity on 24h CXR
- **Action:** **Order CT chest** for retained hemothorax (RH) evaluation

#### C. Hemothorax (HTX)
- **Findings:** No persistent pleural effusion or opacity, **<300 mL** effluent in 24 hours
- **Action:** **Remove chest tube**
- **Follow-up:** Obtain **CXR 4 hours post removal**

### 3. Water Seal Phase
- **4-Hour CXR after WS**
  - No new or stable PTX
  - No air leak
  - <300 mL effluent in last 24 hours
  - No worsening subQE
  - Not on high ventilator settings  
- **Action:** **Remove chest tube** and obtain **4-hour post-pull CXR**

### 4. CT Chest Findings (Retained Hemothorax)
- **If RH volume <300 mL:** Continue conservative management, observe.
- **If RH volume >300 mL:**
  - **Assess surgical candidacy:**
    - **Not a surgical candidate:** Begin **intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT)**  
      - *Alteplase 10 mg + Dornase alfa 5 mg* daily × 3 days
      - Repeat CT chest after 3 days
    - **Surgical candidate:** Proceed to **VATS** or **thoracotomy** for evacuation

## Management Summary (Text-Based Algorithm)
1. **Chest tube placement → suction → confirm on CXR**
2. **At 24h:**
   - If **resolved PTX/HPTX** → water seal  
   - If **persistent opacities/effusion** → CT chest  
   - If **resolved HTX and <300 mL drainage** → remove chest tube  
3. **After water seal (4h):**
   - If no PTX/air leak → remove chest tube  
4. **If CT shows RH >300 mL:**
   - **Poor candidate:** IPFT  
   - **Good candidate:** VATS/thoracotomy

## Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (ACS) Policy on Chest Tube Placement
- The **decision and placement** of chest tubes in **trauma patients** are determined by the **Trauma Chief or Trauma Resident**.  
- If a patient is evaluated by the **Emergency Department (ED)** for **non-trauma-related effusion** (e.g., malignant or parapneumonic effusion), the ED will **consult ACS** for assistance with chest tube management.  
- **ACS will supervise** the procedure, but the **ED resident** performs the **chest tube insertion** under ACS supervision.  
- **All chest tube placements** require **post-procedural imaging** and **documentation of supervision** in the medical record.

## Red Flags / Urgent Triggers
- Worsening PTX or new air leak  
- Drainage **>300 mL/24h**  
- Increasing subcutaneous emphysema  
- Persistent or enlarging pleural opacities on CXR or CT  
- Clinical instability or respiratory compromise
