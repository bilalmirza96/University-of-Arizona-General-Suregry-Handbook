# Rib Fracture Management Protocol (RIG Scoring)

## Definition
The **Rib Injury Guideline (RIG)** provides a structured framework for evaluating, admitting, and managing patients with rib fractures. The RIG score stratifies patients by risk for respiratory compromise and pain-related morbidity, guiding triage, analgesia, and the need for Advanced Pain Service (APS) involvement.

## Principles
- The **RIG score** determines admission level and pain management intensity.  
- Early **multimodal analgesia** and **respiratory optimization** reduce pulmonary complications.  
- Consider **APS consult** for RIG ≥ 6, uncontrolled pain, or epidural indication.  
- **ICU admission** is warranted for high-risk patients (RIG >10) or those requiring advanced airway or analgesic interventions.

## Stepwise Evaluation

### 1. RIG Scoring Criteria

| **Criteria** | **Points** |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:--------:|
| Age > 60 years | **4** |
| Incentive spirometer < 750 mL (assessed 1 hr after PO pain meds) | **4** |
| Imaging shows severe pulmonary contusions (unilateral or bilateral) | **2** |
| >4 rib fractures | **2** |
| History of COPD, smoking, or asthma | **2** |
| Presence of hemothorax, pneumothorax, or chest tube in situ | **2** |
| Pain score >6/10 (1 hr after PO analgesia) | **1** |
| Weak or absent cough | **1** |

**Total Score Interpretation:**
- **>10 points:** ICU admission  
- **3–9 points:** Floor admission  
- **<2 points:** Eligible for discharge  

### 2. Initial Evaluation and Supportive Care
1. Assess pain, oxygenation, and work of breathing.
2. Calculate RIG score.
3. Determine admission level and notify appropriate service (Trauma, ACS, ICU).
4. Encourage incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet on all admitted patients.
5. Begin multimodal analgesia immediately on admission or at time of extubation.

## Management

### Multimodal Analgesia Regimen
**Scheduled (unless contraindicated):**
- **Acetaminophen 650 mg PO q6h**
- **Gabapentin 200 mg PO q8h**
- **Lidocaine transdermal patch (Lidoderm)**
- **Methocarbamol 750 mg PO TID (Robaxin)**
- **Ketorolac** (limit 48 hours; avoid if GFR <30 mL/min, orthopedic injury, or cerebrovascular bleeding)

**PRN Options:**
- **Oxycodone PO** for breakthrough pain  
- **IV Dilaudid or IV Morphine** for uncontrolled pain

**Reassess pain after 8–12 hours.**
- If pain remains **>6/10**, consider **PCA** or **Epidural analgesia** per attending discretion.

### Epidural Analgesia

**Indications:**
- Flail chest  
- Escalating narcotic requirements with persistent pain >6/10  
- Underlying cardiopulmonary disease (COPD, CHF, etc.)

**Contraindications:**
- Patient refusal or inability to consent  
- Platelets <50,000  
- INR >1.5  
- Infection at insertion site  
- Epidural/spinal hematoma  
- **Prophylactic LMWH within 10 hrs** or **therapeutic LMWH within 24 hrs**  
- Major TBI (GCS <9)  
- Hemodynamic instability  
- Deep sedation (RASS < –3)  
- Transverse process fractures near intended insertion level

**Consult APS** for placement and management.

### Pain Escalation Pathway
1. Start multimodal analgesia.
2. If pain >6 despite optimized oral/IV therapy, initiate PCA or epidural.
3. Reassess frequently and titrate therapy based on RIG score and functional pain response.
