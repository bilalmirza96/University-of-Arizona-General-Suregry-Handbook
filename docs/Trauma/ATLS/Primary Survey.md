# Primary Survey and Resuscitation 

## Principles
The primary survey is a structured, rapid assessment to identify and manage **immediately life-threatening injuries**.  
Assessment and resuscitation occur **simultaneously**, following the **ABCDE sequence**.  
Treat the greatest threat to life first and do not delay lifesaving interventions for diagnostic tests.  
Reassess continuously—if deterioration occurs, repeat the entire primary survey.

## Airway with Cervical Spine Protection

### Assessment
- Determine if the patient can speak; the ability to talk implies a patent airway.  
- Look for **stridor, gurgling, noisy respirations, blood, vomitus, or facial trauma**.  
- Assume **cervical spine injury** until proven otherwise.

### Interventions
- Maintain **manual inline stabilization (MILS)** at all times.  
- **Suction** blood and vomitus immediately.  
- Perform **chin lift or jaw thrust** (avoid head tilt).  
- Insert airway adjuncts as indicated:
  - **Oropharyngeal airway:** if unresponsive and without gag reflex.  
  - **Nasopharyngeal airway:** if gag present and no basilar skull fracture.

### Definitive Airway Indications
- **GCS ≤ 8**.  
- Airway obstruction or severe facial/neck trauma.  
- **SpO₂ < 90%** despite high-flow oxygen.  
- Apnea or hypoventilation.

### Definitive Airway Techniques
- **Orotracheal intubation** with inline stabilization (preferred).  
- If unable to intubate or ventilate, perform **surgical or needle cricothyroidotomy**.

**Key Principle:** Always maintain cervical spine protection during airway management.

## Breathing and Ventilation

### Assessment
- Inspect for **symmetrical chest expansion**, wounds, and deformities.  
- Auscultate both lungs for air entry.  
- Percuss for dullness or hyperresonance.  
- Observe respiratory rate, effort, and SpO₂.

### Immediate Life-Threatening Conditions
- **Tension pneumothorax:** needle decompression (14 G at 5th ICS AAL or 2nd ICS MCL) → chest tube.  
- **Open pneumothorax:** apply three-sided occlusive dressing → chest tube.  
- **Massive hemothorax:** chest tube; if >1500 mL initial output or >200 mL/hr × 4 hr → thoracotomy.  
- **Flail chest:** oxygen, analgesia, and ventilatory support as needed.  
- **Cardiac tamponade:** pericardiocentesis and urgent surgical exploration.

### Oxygenation Targets
- **SpO₂ ≥ 94%**, **RR 10–30/min**, **PaCO₂ 35–40 mmHg**.  
- Avoid prophylactic hyperventilation.

**Key Principle:** Diagnose and treat tension pneumothorax clinically—do not delay for imaging.

## Circulation with Hemorrhage Control

### Assessment
- Palpate **central pulses** and assess skin color, temperature, and capillary refill (<2 sec).  
- Control **external bleeding** with direct pressure or tourniquet if needed.  
- Consider **internal bleeding** in chest, abdomen, pelvis, or long bones.

### Access and Monitoring
- Insert **two large-bore (14–16 G)** IVs or **IO access**.  
- Draw blood for **type and cross-match**.  
- Initiate continuous **ECG, BP, SpO₂, temperature, and urine output monitoring**.

### Resuscitation
- **Class I (<15% loss):** monitor; fluids usually not required.  
- **Class II (15–30%):** give 1 L warmed isotonic crystalloid → reassess.  
- **Class III (30–40%):** initiate **massive transfusion (1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets)**.  
- **Class IV (>40%):** immediate transfusion and operative control.

### Targets
- **SBP ≥ 100 mmHg (<65 yr)** or **≥110 mmHg (≥65 yr)**.  
- **MAP ≥ 65 mmHg**.  
- **Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr (adult), 1 mL/kg/hr (child)**.  
- **Lactate < 2 mmol/L** and **Base deficit > –6 mEq/L** indicate adequate perfusion.

### Adjuncts
- Apply **pelvic binder** if pelvic instability suspected.  
- Perform **FAST** or **DPA** for internal hemorrhage assessment.

**Key Principle:** Assume hypotension is due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise.

## Disability (Neurologic Evaluation)

### Assessment
- Determine **GCS (E4 / V5 / M6)**.  
- Examine **pupils** for size, symmetry, and reactivity.  
- Evaluate **motor and sensory function** in all extremities.

### Management
- Prevent **hypoxia and hypotension**; maintain SBP >100 mmHg.  
- Treat **seizures** promptly.  
- If **GCS ≤ 8**, secure a definitive airway and maintain **PaCO₂ 35–40 mmHg**.

### Red Flags
- **Unequal pupils** or **lateralizing signs** suggest intracranial mass lesion → **urgent neurosurgical consultation**.

**Key Principle:** A single episode of hypotension or hypoxia worsens outcomes in TBI—prevent both.

---

## Exposure and Environmental Control

### Actions
- Fully expose the patient; inspect **front, back, axillae, perineum**.  
- Prevent **hypothermia**:
  - Use warm blankets or forced-air warmer.  
  - Warm IV fluids and blood products.  
  - Maintain ambient temperature **>26 °C**.

**Key Principle:** Hypothermia contributes to coagulopathy—actively prevent heat loss.

---

## Adjuncts to the Primary Survey
- Continuous **ECG, SpO₂, and EtCO₂ monitoring**.  
- Obtain **portable chest and pelvic x-rays** and **FAST** as indicated.  
- Insert **urinary catheter** unless urethral injury suspected (blood at meatus, perineal bruising, high-riding prostate).  
- Insert **gastric tube** (orogastric if facial trauma).  
- Draw baseline labs: **CBC, type & cross, lactate, base deficit, ABG, coagulation profile**.

---

## Reevaluation
- Repeat **ABCDE** after each major intervention or change in status.  
- If deterioration occurs, restart at **Airway**.  
- Document all findings and responses.

---

## Transfer and Communication
- Stabilize **airway, breathing, and circulation** before transfer.  
- Maintain **oxygen, IV access, and monitoring** during transport.  
- Communicate **physician-to-physician** with the receiving trauma center.  
- Do not delay transfer for imaging that will not alter immediate management.

---

## Documentation
- Record **time and response** for every intervention.  
- Document **vital signs, GCS components, airway procedures, fluids, blood products, and reassessments**.
