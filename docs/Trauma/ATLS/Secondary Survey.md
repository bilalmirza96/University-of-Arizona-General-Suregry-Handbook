# Secondary Survey and Definitive Management (ATLS-Based PMG)

## Principles
The secondary survey begins **after completion of the primary survey and initial resuscitation** once the patient is hemodynamically stable.  
Its purpose is to perform a **head-to-toe evaluation**, identify **all injuries**, and initiate **definitive management**.  
If deterioration occurs at any point, **return immediately to the primary survey (ABCDE)**.

---

## Preparation
- Confirm that **vital signs are stable** and **resuscitation is ongoing**.  
- Ensure **analgesia and sedation** are adequate.  
- Maintain **spinal precautions** throughout.  
- Continue **monitoring**: ECG, SpO₂, BP, temperature, and urine output.  
- Warm the patient and maintain a **normothermic environment**.

## History and Mechanism of Injury

### AMPLE History
- **A – Allergies**  
- **M – Medications** (including anticoagulants, insulin, beta-blockers, etc.)  
- **P – Past medical history** (comorbidities, pregnancy status, tetanus immunization)  
- **L – Last meal** (important for anesthesia)  
- **E – Events / Environment** leading to injury (mechanism, time, extrication, associated hazards)

### Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
Evaluate for energy transfer and injury pattern correlation:
- **Blunt trauma:** MVC, fall, assault, blast.  
- **Penetrating trauma:** knife, firearm — note trajectory and object characteristics.  
- **Blast injuries:** consider primary (barotrauma), secondary (shrapnel), tertiary (impact), and quaternary (burn/inhalation) effects.  
Understanding mechanism predicts hidden injuries and guides imaging.

## Systematic Head-to-Toe Examination

### Head and Scalp
- Inspect and palpate for **lacerations, hematomas, deformities, depression, or CSF leak**.  
- Examine **eyes**: pupils (size/reactivity), conjunctiva, orbital integrity.  
- Assess **ears**: hemotympanum, CSF otorrhea.  
- Examine **nose**: septal hematoma, CSF rhinorrhea.  
- Evaluate **mouth and jaw**: loose teeth, malocclusion, facial fractures, bleeding.  
- Control scalp bleeding with **direct pressure**; avoid blind clamping.

### Neck
- Maintain **cervical immobilization** during exam.  
- Inspect for **bruising, seatbelt marks, hematoma, or tracheal deviation**.  
- Palpate for **subcutaneous emphysema, laryngeal crepitus, tenderness**.  
- Assess **JVD** (tamponade vs. tension physiology).  
- Evaluate for **neurologic deficit or hoarseness** suggesting laryngeal/tracheal injury.  
- Do **not** remove cervical collar until cleared by clinical and radiographic criteria.

### Chest
- Inspect for **abrasions, contusions, penetrating wounds, or flail segments**.  
- Palpate for **tenderness, deformity, subcutaneous emphysema, rib instability**.  
- Percuss for **dullness or hyperresonance**.  
- Auscultate both lungs and heart.  
- Reassess chest tube function if present.  
- Obtain **portable chest x-ray** and **monitor oxygenation**.

### Abdomen
- Inspect for **ecchymosis (seatbelt sign), distension, penetrating wounds**.  
- Palpate gently for **tenderness, guarding, rigidity, masses**.  
- Percuss for dullness or tympany; auscultate for bowel sounds.  
- Evaluate for **pelvic stability** with gentle pressure once.  
- Perform **FAST**; if positive and unstable → laparotomy.  
- Consider **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** if stable.

### Pelvis and Perineum
- Inspect for **lacerations, ecchymosis, bleeding from urethra, vagina, or rectum**.  
- Check **pelvic stability once only**; if unstable, apply **pelvic binder** immediately.  
- Examine **perineum** for hematoma or laceration.  
- **Rectal exam**: assess tone, presence of blood, bony fragments, high-riding prostate.  
- **Vaginal exam** in females with pelvic fractures or suspected vaginal injury.

### Extremities
- Inspect for **deformity, wounds, bleeding, or amputation**.  
- Palpate for **tenderness, crepitus, distal pulses, and capillary refill**.  
- Assess **motor, sensory, and perfusion status** (5 P’s: pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness).  
- Immobilize fractures and dislocations with splints.  
- Control external bleeding with **pressure or tourniquet** if necessary.  
- Consider **compartment syndrome** in crush or long-bone injuries.

### Back and Posterior Surface
- Logroll with **four-person technique** maintaining spinal alignment.  
- Inspect the entire back, buttocks, and posterior thighs.  
- Palpate spine for **tenderness, step-offs, or deformity**.  
- Examine posterior wounds carefully before re-positioning.

## Adjuncts to the Secondary Survey
- **Diagnostic imaging** as indicated: CT head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis, spine films.  
- **Laboratory evaluation:** CBC, electrolytes, renal function, coagulation, lactate, ABG.  
- **Urinalysis:** check for hematuria.  
- **Toxicology screen** if indicated.  
- **Foley catheter** (unless urethral injury suspected).  
- **NG/OG tube** for gastric decompression (OG if facial trauma).  
- **Pain control** and **tetanus prophylaxis** as required.

## Special Considerations
### Pediatric Patients
- Use weight-based resuscitation (Broselow tape).  
- Pediatric anatomy increases risk of airway obstruction and intra-abdominal injury without external signs.

### Geriatric Patients
- Limited physiologic reserve; normal vitals may mask shock.  
- High risk for intracranial hemorrhage on anticoagulants.

### Pregnant Patients
- Evaluate both **mother and fetus**.  
- Use **left lateral uterine displacement** after 20 weeks to relieve IVC compression.  
- **Fetal monitoring** if viable gestational age.  
- **Administer Rh immunoglobulin** to all Rh-negative mothers with torso trauma.

---

## Reevaluation
- Continuously reassess vital signs and mental status.  
- Repeat focused exams after every intervention or if condition changes.  
- Any deterioration requires immediate **return to primary survey**.

---

## Definitive Care and Disposition
- Identify injuries requiring **operative intervention or specialist consultation**.  
- Coordinate **transfer or admission** based on injury pattern and facility capability.  
- Provide **clear handoff** using **SBAR** or **MIST** format.  
- Continue resuscitation, monitoring, and warming measures during transfer.  
- Document all findings, diagnostics, and interventions performed.

---

## Documentation
- Record **all examination findings, imaging results, and interventions**.  
- Note **vital trends, neurologic status, wound locations, and definitive management plans**.  
- Document **tetanus status**, **analgesia given**, and **consultations obtained**.
