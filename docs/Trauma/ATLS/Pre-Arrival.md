# Pre-Arrival and Trauma Bay Preparation 

## Principles
Trauma resuscitation begins **before patient arrival**.  
The objective is a **safe, organized, and fully prepared environment** that allows immediate lifesaving intervention.  
Preparation saves lives — ensure that **equipment, personnel, and the environment** are ready before starting the primary survey.  
Do not delay critical actions once the patient enters the room.



## Team Organization and Leadership
- **Identify the team leader** before arrival.  
- **Assign and confirm roles:**
  - **Airway:** prepare for intubation.
  - **Breathing:** chest access, oxygen setup, thoracostomy readiness.
  - **Circulation:** IV access, blood draw, MTP setup.
  - **Monitor:** ECG, SpO₂, BP, temperature.
  - **Recorder:** document vitals, interventions, and times.
  - **Runner:** manage supplies, coordinate x-ray, labs, and blood products.
- Establish **closed-loop communication** and confirm understanding (“copy” / “understood”).
- Reinforce teamwork and safety: *“If anyone identifies a safety issue, speak up.”*



## Safety and Environment
- All team members must wear **PPE** (gloves, gown, mask, face protection).  
- Maintain room temperature **≥26 °C** to prevent hypothermia.  
- Ensure **adequate lighting** and a **clear workspace**.  
- Verify **sharps containers and spill management** availability.  
- Prepare **warm blankets and active warming devices**.  
- Maintain a **safe environment** for staff and patient at all times.



## Equipment and Supply Readiness

### Airway
- Confirm **suction** is functional and canister empty.  
- Ensure **oxygen source >1000 psi** and flowmeter operational.  
- Prepare **bag-valve-mask** with reservoir and tubing.  
- Check **laryngoscope light**, and prepare **ETTs (7.0–8.0 mm)** with stylet and CO₂ detector.  
- Keep **cricothyroidotomy set** open and visible.  
- Draw up **RSI medications** (sedative, paralytic, flushes).

### Breathing
- **Open chest-tube tray (36–40 Fr)** and attach drainage system.  
- Prepare **14 G needle** for decompression at **5th ICS AAL**.  
- Place **occlusive dressings** and scissors nearby.  
- Confirm **ventilator** or O₂ circuit readiness.

### Circulation
- Insert **two large-bore (14–16 G)** IVs or have ready.  
- Ensure **rapid infuser**, **pressure bags**, and **fluid warmers** functional.  
- Prime and hang **warmed Ringer’s lactate**.  
- Place **pelvic binder** and **tourniquets** at bedside.  
- Confirm **IO access kit** and **MTP cooler** available.  
- **Warm all fluids and blood** to avoid hypothermia/coagulopathy.

### Monitoring and Adjuncts
- Attach **ECG, SpO₂, BP cuff, temperature probe**.  
- Power on **FAST ultrasound**.  
- Prepare **Foley and NG/OG tubes**.  
- Ensure **portable x-ray** and **lead aprons** ready.  
- Set up **point-of-care testing** (ABG, glucose, lactate).



## Pre-Arrival Brief (Team Huddle)
- Conduct **2–3 minutes before arrival**.  
- **Team leader summarizes:**
  - Mechanism and expected injuries.  
  - Anticipated interventions (airway, MTP, thoracostomy).  
  - Individual task assignments and sequence.  
- Confirm readiness verbally:
  > “Suction on, oxygen on, IV fluids warmed, chest tray open.”  
- Reinforce communication:
  > “I will call out ABCDE — speak up with critical findings.”  
A brief, structured huddle ensures a shared mental model and readiness for high-risk interventions.



## Final Cross-Checks Before Entry
- Suction functional and within reach.  
- Oxygen flowing and visible.  
- Bag-valve-mask assembled and tested.  
- Chest-tube tray open with sterile gloves available.  
- Warmed fluids running through warmer.  
- Pelvic binder at bedside.  
- Ultrasound probe clean with gel ready.  
- Defibrillator powered and charged.



## Medications and Blood Products
- **RSI agents:**
  - *Etomidate 0.3 mg/kg* or *Ketamine 1.5 mg/kg*.  
  - *Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg* or *Rocuronium 1 mg/kg*.  
- **Vasopressors** available (norepinephrine / epinephrine).  
- **TXA 1 g IV** in 100 mL NS over 10 min (if < 3 hr from injury).  
- **Tetanus prophylaxis** drawn and labeled.  
- **Analgesics** (morphine, fentanyl) ready post-stabilization.



## Handoff Reception (MIST)
- Assign one person to receive the prehospital report.  
- Use **MIST** format:
  - **M:** Mechanism of injury  
  - **I:** Injuries found or suspected  
  - **S:** Signs (vital parameters)  
  - **T:** Treatment provided and time of injury  
- Confirm **time of injury** and **fluids given**.  
- Direct transfer to bed and begin primary survey.

**Leader statement:**
> “Thank you. Team ready, patient to bed.  
> Beginning primary survey — Airway and cervical spine protection.”



## Quality and Safety
- Remove backboard promptly once spine precautions are secured.  
- Keep the patient and room **warm**.  
- Maintain clear equipment access and staff pathways.  
- Document **arrival time, first vitals, interventions** immediately.  
- Dispose of sharps safely after use.



## Transition to Primary Survey
**Leader confirmation:**
> “Monitors on, suction and oxygen functional, team in PPE, MIST received.  
> Beginning primary survey — Airway and cervical spine protection.”
